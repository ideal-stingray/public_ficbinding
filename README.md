# Public Ficbinding

Public typesets and LaTeX source files for Alpaca Laboratories Press.

## Hey, where are the typesets for `$THING_I_SAW_YOU_POST_ON_TUMBLR`?

I don't make all my typesets public.  In the case of danmei fan translations, most
translators prefer that their translations not be reposted online, and I'm trying
to respect that.  In the case of fanfiction, I'd want author permission first.
However, I'm willing to share PDFs and source files for anything over
Discord DMs or email -- you can reach me at ideal-stingray#0363 on Discord or at
ideal-stingray@protonmail.com.  (You can also reach me [on Tumblr](https://gender-trash.tumblr.com),
but I can't attach PDFs to tumblr DMs, so...)

That said, I also don't generally bother to copy things out of my private
typesetting repo unless there's a specific request.

## Can you typeset a cnovel or a fic for me?

Maybe!  Send me a message!

My SLA is quite slow because I have a full-time job, ADHD,
and a lot of other time-consuming hobbies.  I'm more likely to do things
if I know someone else is interested in them, but I'm less likely to do
things that *I'm* not personally interested in.  If you want a fic that's
in my [AO3 bookmarks](https://archiveofourown.org/users/optimal_stingray/bookmarks),
your chances are probably good.

(Also, I usually copyedit things while I typeset.  Your chances are better
if the fic or novel does not require too much copyediting.)

However, the final product will be in accordance with my personal
tastes.  If you have specific aesthetic requests you will need to either
edit the source files yourself or pay me an amount of money.  (I am also
more likely to typeset your thing in the first place if you pay
me an amount of money.)  Note that paying me money does not change
the SLA and that I am still a flaky bitch who might randomly stop
typesetting the thing and spend two months quilting instead.

(Some ficbinders prefer to get author permission before typesetting something.
My personal feeling is that printing a fic as a book is not morally different from
downloading it for offline reading, something I'm also okay with doing without
author permission.)

## Can you send me an epub for something you've typeset?

I've experimented briefly with creating epubs from TeX files using pandoc; generally
the footnotes get fucked up.  I can send you the PDF (which may not work well on
mobile), and/or I can send you the TeX source (which you _can_ read on a phone if
you're determined), and/or you can pay me an amount of money and I'll put some effort
into making a clean epub with correct footnotes.

## Will you bind a physical book for me?

No, but there are other fan binders who take commissions.

## Can I copy some code out of your TeX files?

That's what they're here for.  Go for it, no need to credit me.
